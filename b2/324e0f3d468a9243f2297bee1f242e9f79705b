Alright after the merge, we now would need to do exactly the opposite for PHP 7.1 :smile:

I've updated the PR to remove the PHPUNIT version line completely. If not explicitly set, the `simple-phpunit` binary already chooses the correct version based on the available PHP version ([ref](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/5.x/src/Symfony/Bridge/PhpUnit/bin/simple-phpunit.php#L96-L104)).

thanks @wouterj - nice to finally see a green check next to PHP8.0!
