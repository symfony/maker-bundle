How about adding new test cases to make sure these behave as intended?
It should be easy enough to add them right here: https://github.com/symfony/maker-bundle/blob/a1b0d9ff35219ec36c44fcc6213056cc339a1cf8/tests/GeneratorTwigHelperTest.php#L31

I agree! And actually, this test could be even a little bit cooler if we actually "rendered" the result through Twig (passing in some real `entity` object) and asserted the final *output* (instead of or in addition to asserting the Twig code that should be printed). But... that's not a requirement :).

@sadikoff Can you rebase this? I want to make sure the tests pass with the latest changes on master. Also, there are 2 changes in this PR to `.travis.yml` - do we want those?

@weaverryan ok, I'll rebase it

P.S. I think travis will be more stable with this changes
