OK, so while I am not happy with my choice of method naming nor elegance — ideas/suggestions very welcome! — I think I've addressed your concerns.

I started with a baseline of a fresh `composer create-project symfony/website-skeleton`, which already has two autoloaders. So I figured the best approach now is to "remember" the autoloader that contains the component, and should the match still not be found, using that as the fallback.

Also, I've slightly expanded the tests to cover PSR-0, PSR-4 & fallback.

> 1. What's the edge case that we're trying to solve by falling back to the autoloader that contains this bundle's namespace? I'd prefer to not do this, but I might be missing some legitimate use-case.

Specifically for the fallback option, and _assuming_ `symfony/maker-bundle` is installed via Composer:
  - It is a namespace we know will be in the Composer autoloader
  - The end-project root namespace is a config setting, so could be wrong, or missing
  - The end-project `composer.json` is not guaranteed to have its own `psr-4` or `psr-0` defined and loading, or not 'dumped' by Composer yet

> 2. If we don't need that, we can return from all the methods, instead of setting the property directly.

Done :grinning:
