This is rebased and ready. I'm still getting false fabbot failures on the `[]` array syntax...

Changes made... except for the one change...

Changes made! fabbot still dislikes me, but it's unrelated :)

@fabpot any idea why fabbot would not use the config file in the repo ?

@stof nice catch! I've just added php-cs-fixer to the tests, so that we can verify the generated files follow coding standards (especially important because that empty line stuff is very easy to mess up).

Thanks!
