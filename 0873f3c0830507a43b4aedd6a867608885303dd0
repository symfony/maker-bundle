Hey @LeJeanbono!

This is impressive. Seriously, that class is a BEAST, so nice job getting into it. The fix works on all versions *except* for PHP 7.3 (see the build failure). Can you check into it?

Thanks!

I think it's a problem with PCRE with preg_match in 7.3
I saw something with comments : https://www.php.net/manual/en/regexp.reference.comments.php
