Hi @Rootie,

Can you please update the description and PR so it can be reviewed?

Cheers!

Hi @sadikoff,

i updated the description.

I also wanted to note that if keeping the default value for array fields is wanted, then it is also possible to just modify the addGetter call in Util\ClassSourceManipulator::addEntityField

This makes sense to me. Could you rebase so we can check the tests?
