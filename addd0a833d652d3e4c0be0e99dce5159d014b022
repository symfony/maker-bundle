Hey!

Thanks for this! But, Iâ€™m honestly not sure if one is more right than the other. What motivated the change?

Cheers!

Hi I'm using codacy to review my code and the error throw there but the 4 spaces rule is explicitly written in [PSR-2: Coding Style Guide](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/#1-overview) a standard used in [Symfony Coding Standards](https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/standards.html)
See you!
