Hi!

Thanks for this :).

1) I'm fine with the single-line format - `/** ... *`
2) Perhaps we should - as a convention - prefix all these properties? e.g. `$inputFromEmailAddress` and `$inputFromEmailName`?
3) In general, if a doc block doesn't add anything, then let's not include it - I'm 👍 for that

Cheers!
