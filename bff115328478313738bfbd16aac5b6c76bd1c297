Quick question: what was wrong with redirecting back to edit? Was it just not what people are normally expecting?

It's not what you'd expect after editing - especially not without a flash message indicating a successful edit.
Workflow-wise I think it's best to go back to the index, at least that's what I do in most client work.

It was reported by someone and @javiereguiluz tagged it as a bug and I stumbled over it when testing other stuff today, too.

I disagree ðŸ‘Ž .

Redirect to `edit` action was here from the beginning. We can see it in symfony demo app and in SensioGeneratorBundle, and even in very old symfony 1.4 admin generator.

After all it's not admin generator it's just crud skeleton and every user should configure it as he wants

I can see it both ways. After creating a new "item", we redirect back to the index page. This PR would make that consistent. I lightly lean towards YES let's merge this.

I don't think that it's the status quo is an argument for keeping it.

The crud is often used for quick examples, especially when learning things from the docs.
The current behaviour with redirecting to the edit page after successfully editing, without any success message is confusing and people (including me) think that something is broken.

I'm against adding flash messages to the generated controller, as it's out of scope.
But redirecting back to the index could be seen as the least viable replacement for a success message.
