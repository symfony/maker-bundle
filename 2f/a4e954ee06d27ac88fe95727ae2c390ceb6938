@kbond - is this ready to move forward? a rebase and tests would be awesome when you get some free time

Sorry for the delay. Updated this PR to work with the latest version of twig/live components. If we are good with the templates/maker, I'll add tests.

Ok, this is ready. Assuming https://github.com/symfony/ux/pull/460 is merged, we can add support for this in the maker.
