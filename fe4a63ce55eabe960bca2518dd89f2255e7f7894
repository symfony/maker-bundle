Hi,

according to a chat i had with @weaverryan i've completed this maker in order to allow the user to route the message to a transport

I am routing my Messages based on an „AsyncMessage“-Marker Interface, is it worth to add such an option instead of manipulating the messenger.yaml file?

It’s a very interesting idea... but I don’t think it’s standard enough yet to put into maker. Better to show them where/how routing happens

i kinda agree with @weaverryan. Although it is a nice trick, it may involve too much complexity and different cases to handle in the maker.

BTW, the CI is failing because of some deprecation i fixed here: https://github.com/symfony/maker-bundle/pull/518
