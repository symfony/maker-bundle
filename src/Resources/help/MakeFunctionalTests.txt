The <info>%command.name%</info> command generates HTTP functional tests based on the routes defined
in your application.

<info>php %command.full_name% [route-name]</info>

The route name is optionnal: if it is missing, the command will generate HTTP functional tests for
all the routes in your application.

You can safely run this command multiple times. On each call, a new HTTP functional test will be
created for each new route and previously created files won't be modified.

However, if you need to, you can use the <info>--force</info> option to overwrite tests files with the
MakerBundle generated code.
