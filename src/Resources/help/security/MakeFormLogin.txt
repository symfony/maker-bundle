The <info>%command.name%</info> command generates a controller and twig template
to allow users to login using SecurityBundle's Form Login Authenticator.

The controller name, and logout ability can be customized by answering the
questions asked when running <info>%command.name%</info>.

In all cases, this will update your <info>security.yaml</info> to work with
the built-in authenticators provided by SecurityBundle.

<info>php %command.full_name%</info>
