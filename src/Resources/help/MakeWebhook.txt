The <info>%command.name%</info> command creates a RequestParser, a WebhookHandler and adds the necessary configuration
for a new Webhook.

<info>php %command.full_name% stripe</info>

If the argument is missing, the command will ask for the webhook name interactively.

It will also interactively ask for the RequestMatchers to use for the RequestParser's getRequestMatcher function.
