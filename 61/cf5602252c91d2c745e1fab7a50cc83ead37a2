Hello,

I have some mixed feelings about using a `BadMethodCallException`.
From PHP manual, `Exception thrown if a callback refers to an undefined method or if some arguments are missing.`, I feel like we don't quite have the same semantic.
Is there any reason why this exception is better?
Personally, I would prefer a `LogicException`.

Anyway, just exception is not cool

Sure. Then could you please modify with `LogicException`, and fix failing test?
Thank you

I fixed it, but it seems that tests are broken
