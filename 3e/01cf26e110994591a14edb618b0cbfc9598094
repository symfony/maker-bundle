What if someone still uses DBAL 3 and relies on those deprecated types?

I suggest putting the type name as a string for those instead of removing them entirely for those legacy types (as done for the `uuid` and `ulid` types)

You're right! I've added backward compatibility. I just thought that adding the BC for something that has already been deprecated in the past is not really worth it in the maker bundle.
