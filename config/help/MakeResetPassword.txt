The <info>%command.name%</info> command generates all the files needed to implement
 a fully-functional & secure password reset system.

The SymfonycastsResetPasswordBundle is required and can be added using composer:
<info>composer require symfonycasts/reset-password-bundle</info>

For more information on the <info>reset-password-bundle</info> check out:
<href=https://github.com/symfonycasts/reset-password-bundle>https://github.com/symfonycasts/reset-password-bundle</>

<info>%command.name%</info> requires a user entity with an email property,
email getter method, and a password setter method. Maker will ask for these
interactively if they cannot be guessed.

Maker will also update your <info>reset-password.yaml</info> configuration file
if one exists. If you have customized the configuration file, maker will attempt
to modify it accordingly but preserve your customizations.

<info>php %command.full_name%</info>
