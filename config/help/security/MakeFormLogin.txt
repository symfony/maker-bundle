The <info>%command.name%</info> command generates a controller and Twig template
to allow users to login using the form_login authenticator.

The controller name, and logout ability can be customized by answering the
questions asked when running <info>%command.name%</info>.

This will also update your <info>security.yaml</info> for the new authenticator.

<info>php %command.full_name%</info>
