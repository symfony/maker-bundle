The <info>%command.name%</info> command generates various authentication systems,
by asking questions.

It can provide an empty authenticator, or a full login form authentication process.
In both cases it also updates your <info>security.yaml</info>.
For the login form, it also generates a controller and the twig template.

<info>php %command.full_name%</info>
