why the change? If we change it here, we should be consistent across all Symfony repos that use GH Actions. There may already be a PR for this over on symfony/symfony (at a glance I did not see one) but symfony uses https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/5.x/.github/workflows/tests.yml

For outsider context - github actions is capable of either `.yaml` or `.yml`. For Symfony sake, it would make sense to use `.yaml` as this is what we do in symfony itself.

Exactly. We can rename the others accordingly 👍
