The underlying problem is that 1.1 of the `serializer-pack` requires 5.4 or greater of `symfony/property-info`, so it has problems installing: https://github.com/symfony/serializer-pack/blob/main/composer.json#L15

I'm not sure of the best fix. If the user has Symfony 5.3, it's true that running the `composer require` line - that the command would tell you to run - will fail (just as it does in the CI). However, I don't think we should try to "figure out" in MakerBundle what version of the serializer-pack would be compatible so we can tweak our `composer require` line accordingly. That just seems nuts. So, this is probably the best solution, though it's not ideal. We should at least add a comment above the new lines in the test to explain what's going on.
