Hello,
Thanks for the feedback and the PR.
I'm having mixed feelings, because we still had a `<label>` for screen reader, so it was IMO it was OK regarding accessibility. Only thing is that `sr-only` class require Bootstrap ; so maybe we should make default theme less Bootstrap dependant? Really, I don't know.
