Thanks for digging into this @Curryed.

What about removing the `@return` docblock and just letting the `UserInterface` dictate? I typically never override docblocks from interfaces/abstract classes (unless required) but maybe I'm in the minority?

Sure! If that's the way you usually go for 😁

I updated the it removing the `@return` :)
